## Installation

Clone this repo using below command.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jooy2/nextplat <PROJECT_NAME>
```

Then, install the dependency module.

```shell
$ npm i
```

## Initialize the project

Type `npm run init` in the command. Keep in mind that it is different from `npm init`.

The script automatically creates an environment variable file containing the necessary variables and other public files (`manifest.json`, `robots.txt`).

If you do not proceed with this process, the website may not work properly.

When you do this, the previously set files may be reset.

```shell
$ npm run init

[NextPlat] Enter your website domain (Default: example.com):
[NextPlat] Enter your website author name (Default: NextPlat):
[NextPlat] Enter your website author email (Default: admin@example.com):
[NextPlat] Would you like to enable the database function? (Enter 'Y' or 'N'):
...
```

## Testing in development & production

You can test your project in the development environment using the following command:

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

To build into a production environment, first build the Next.js page by entering the following command:

```shell
$ npm run client:build
```

If a folder called `.next` is created at the top of the project, you can test the production environment with the following command.

```shell
$ npm run start
```

## Using global `PageRoot` component per page

If you use the `components/layouts/PageRoot.js` component for each page of Next.js, you can easily include the common layout of the page as well as useful functions such as SEO and page scrolling.

You can use `PageRoot` in the topmost component of each page as shown below.

```javascript
const Index = () => {
  return (
    <PageRoot title="About Me" desc="Hello.">
      <div>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
      </div>
    </PageRoot>
  );
};
```

### Default PageRoot Props

```text
{
  // Set the title of the meta tag to the desired value.
  "title": string,
  // Set the description of the meta tag to the desired value.
  "desc": string,
  // Customize the text to be added to the end of the title tag. Available when the value of withTail prop is true.
  "headerTitle": string,
  // If this value is true, the header is enabled. (default: true)
  "header": boolean,
  // If this value is true, the container is enabled. (default: true)
  "container": boolean,
  // If this value is true, the footer is enabled. (default: true)
  "footer": boolean,
  // If this value is true, the site name is appended to the end of the value of the title meta tag. (default: true)
  "withTail": boolean,
  // If this value is true, the scroll moves to the top every time the page is moved. (default: true)
  "scrollToTop": boolean,
  // If this value is true, it will prevent robots.txt from indexing this page. (default: false)
  "noIndex": boolean,
  // Next-seo's per-page OpenGraph settings. (default: {})
  "openGraph": object
}
```

## Database Configurations

When the Next.js custom server starts, the database is initialized with the connection information. Default schema files can be defined in `server/models`.

- See Sequelize's documentation for details: https://sequelize.org/master/index.html

A `.db-connection.json` file must be created in the root path to read connection information.

The contents of this file are written by referring to the `.db-connection.json.example` file in the root path.

Note that different `development` and `production` environments use different connection information.

```text
...
"development": {
  "username": "user",
  "password": "pass",
  "database": "mydb",
  "host": "example.com",
  "port": 3306,
  "timezone": "+09:00",
  "dialectOptions": {
    "decimalNumbers": true
  },
  "dialect": "mariadb",
  "operatorsAliases": 0
},
...
```

### How to disable database connection?

If you do not want to use the database connection for various reasons, change the value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_DATABASE` to `false` in the env file suitable for the current environment.

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_DATABASE=false
```

This value can be changed by prompt when initializing the project with `npm run init`. This only prevents DB connection and initialization work when running the Next.js server.

If you want to completely disable the database, you will need to uninstall the preinstalled `sequelize` and `mariadb` modules and delete the related code.
